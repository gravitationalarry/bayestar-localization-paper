\begin{abstract}
Timely \acl{EM} follow\nobreakdashes-up of \acl{CBC} events detected by \acl{aLIGO} requires rapidly inferring the sky location from the \ac{GW} observations. Calculation of the posterior distribution of the sky location and intrinsic source parameters given the \ac{GW} strain takes hours with state\nobreakdashes-of\nobreakdashes-the\nobreakdashes-art \ac{MCMC} parameter estimation codes. By taking as the measurement not the \ac{GW} strain itself but the amplitude and \acl{TOA} of the putative signal at each detector, and by fixing the intrinsic source parameters, we have constructed a non-\ac{MCMC}, fully deterministic Bayesian parameter estimation algorithm that takes just seconds to produce sky maps of posterior probability.%

\section{Introduction}

Ground-based \ac{GW} interferometers are entering the advanced detector era, positioning themselves to make profound discoveries about the universe. The \ac{aLIGO} and Vigo detectors will be part of a worldwide network that also includes KAGRA and hopefully LIGO-India. Coalescing neutron star binaries are among the most likely sources, with event rates of $~ 50/\mathrm{yr}$~\cite{rates}.%
%
\marginpar{Check that number.}
%
In addition to being an efficient source of \acp{GW}, the \ac{NS} may be tidally shredded before merging, providing fuel for an electromagnetic counterpart. The short-lived accretion flow may power a collimated relativistic jet, resulting in a short \ac{GRB} and an X-ray afterglow if it is aligned with the line of sight. An optical afterglow may follow minutes to hours later as the jet plows into the interstellar medium. As surrounding neutron-rich ejecta decay radioactively, an optical `kilonova' may be visible after $\sim$1 day \cite{metzger:2010}. Finally, as the ejecta plow into the interstellar medium, a faint radio afterglow could occur on a timescale of weeks to years \cite{Nakar:2011cw}.

There is therefore a strong case for performing electromagnetic followups of these sources of \acp{GW}. Indeed, the final science run of the intitial LIGO and Virgo instruments saw the first joint search for \acp{GW} from compact binaries and their electromagnetic counterparts \cite{abadie2012first}.  As we prepare for the next generation of these searches there is a need for determining the location of the source as precisely as possible in as little time as possible.

In this paper we present a rapid and accurate method of sky localization that makes use of Bayesian methods. It differs from existing techniques is several important ways.  In the first place, we fix the intrinsic parameters to their \ac{ML} estimates, as provided by the detection pipeline.  This reduces the dimensionality of the parameter we need to search. In addition, the technique takes as its input the \ac{ML} estimates of the extrinsic parameters, instead of the $h(t)$ time series. This makes the likelihood itself much faster to evaluate. Finally, instead of of using \ac{MCMC} or some similar method for statistical sampling, we make use of a deterministic quadrature scheme. We call this technique \ac{BAYESTAR}%

The name also suggests that, like the Cylons, \acp{GW} detectors may some day rise against us humans.}%

\section{Setup}

A laser interferometer senses \acp{GW} by transducing differential changes in arm length to a digitized photocurrent time series. In the angular frequency domain, a single detector's observation $X_i(\omega)$ is
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:signal-model}
	x_i (\omega) = h_i (\omega; \boldsymbol\theta) + n_i (\omega),
\end{equation}
%
where $h_i (\omega; \boldsymbol\theta)$ is the \ac{GW} signal receied by detector $i$, given a parameter vector $\boldsymbol\theta$ that describes the \ac{GW} source, and $n_i (\omega)$ is that detector's \ac{WSS} Gaussian noise with \ac{PSD} $S_i(\omega)$. We shall denote the combined observation from a network of detectors as $\mathbf x (\omega) \equiv \{x_i (\omega)\}_i$.

The likelihood, or the probability of obtaining the observation $\mathbf x$ conditioned on the value of $\boldsymbol\theta$, is Gaussian, with the log\nobreakdashes-likelihood proportional to:
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:gaussian-likelihood}
	\mathcal{L}(\mathbf x; \boldsymbol\theta) = \prod_i p(x_i | \boldsymbol\theta)
		\propto \exp \left[
		- \frac{1}{2} \sum_i \int_0^\infty \frac{\left|x_i (\omega)
			- h_i(\omega; \boldsymbol\theta) \right|^2}{S_i(\omega)} \, \mathrm{d}\omega
	\right].
\end{equation}

A \ac{CBC} source is specified by a vector of extrinsic parameters describing its position and orientation and intrinsic parameters describing the physical properties of the binary components:
%
\begin{equation}
    \boldsymbol\theta = \begin{array}{l@{}l}
            \left[
            \begin{array}{c}
                \alpha \\

                \mathbf S_2
            \end{array}
            \right] &
            \begin{array}{l}
                \left.
                \begin{array}{p{4cm}}

                \end{array}
                \quad \right\} \textnormal{extrinsic parameters}, \boldsymbol\theta_\mathrm{ex} \\
                \left.
                \begin{array}{p{4cm}}

                    first component's spin \\
                    second component's spin
                \end{array}
                \quad \right\} \textnormal{intrinsic parameters}, \boldsymbol\theta_\mathrm{in}
            \end{array}
        \end{array}
\end{equation}
%
Binary eccentricity is omitted as an intrinisc parameter because tidal interaction of the progenitor stars~\cite{0004-637X-572-1-407} and later \ac{GW} emission~\cite{PhysRev.136.B1224} circularize the orbit long before the inspiral enters \ac{LIGO}'s frequency range of $\sim$10\nobreakdashes--1000~kHz. Tidal deformabilities of the \acp{NS} are omitted because the effect of tides on the inspiral would only be detectable by an Einstein Telescope-class \ac{GW} observatory~\cite{PhysRevD.81.123016}. Furthermore, in \ac{GW} detection efforts, especially those focused on \ac{NSNS} systems, the component spins $\mathbf{S}_1$ and $\mathbf{S}_2$ are often assumed to be aligned with the system's total angular momentum and condensed to a single scalar parameter $\chi$, or even neglected entirely, $\mathbf{S}_1 = \mathbf{S}_2 = 0$. In this work we will consider only zero spin.

Assuming circular orbits and no spin precession, we can write the \ac{GW} signal in each detector as a linear combination of two basis waveforms $h_0$ and $h_{\pi/2}$. For nonprecessing systems, $h = h_0$ and $h_{\pi/2}$ are approximately ``in quadrature'' in the same sense as the sine and cosine functions, being nearly orthogonal and out of phase by ${\pi/2}$ at all frequencies. In other words, $h_{\pi/2}(\omega) = i h_0(\omega)$ for all $\omega$. This linear combination isolates all dependence on the extrinsic parameters $\boldsymbol\theta_\mathrm{ex}$ into the coefficients and all dependence on the intrinsic parameters $\boldsymbol\theta_\mathrm{in}$ into the basis waveform,
%
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq:full-signal-model}
	\fl h_i(\omega; \boldsymbol\theta) &=& e^{-i\omega t_\oplus}\frac{D_{1,i}}{D_\mathrm{L}}
	\left(\begin{array}{cc}
		F_{+,i}(\alpha, \delta, t_\oplus) \\
		F_{\times,i}(\alpha, \delta, t_\oplus)
	\end{array}\right)^\intercal
	\left(\begin{array}{cc}
		\cos{2\psi} & -\sin{2\psi} \\
		\sin{2\psi} & \cos{2\psi}
	\end{array}\right)
	\left(\begin{array}{cc}
		\frac{1}{2}\left(1+\cos^2{\iota}\right) & 0 \\
		0 & \cos{\iota}
	\end{array}\right) \nonumber\\\fl &\cdot&
	\left(\begin{array}{cc}
		\cos{2\phi_c} & -\sin{2\phi_c} \\
		\sin{2\phi_c} & \cos{2\phi_c}
	\end{array}\right)
	\left(\begin{array}{cc}
		1 \\
		i
	\end{array}\right) h(\omega; \boldsymbol\theta_\mathrm{in}).
\end{eqnarray}
%
This linear combination matches the conventions used in \cite{PhysRevD.83.084002}, and is the frequency-domain equivalent of their Equation~(2.8). The quantities $F_{+,i}$ and $F_{\times,i}$ are the dimensionless detector antenna factors, and depend on the orientation of detector $i$ as well as the sky location and sidereal time of the event, and are derived in~\cite{PhysRevD.63.042003}. The quantity $D_{1,i}$ is a fiducial horizon distance for detector $i$,
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:horizon}
D_{1,i} = 1 / \sigma_i, \qquad {\sigma_i}^2 = \int_0^\infty \frac{\left|h(\omega; \mathbf \theta)\right|^2}{S_i(\omega)} \,\mathrm{d}\omega.
\end{equation}

\subsection{Detection, and matched filter bank as a \ac{MLE}}

More succinctly, we can write the signal received by detector $i$ in terms of direct observables, the amplitude $\rho_i$, phase $\gamma_i$, and time delay $\tau_i$ on arrival at detector $i$,
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:signal-model}
	h_i (\omega; \boldsymbol\theta) = \frac{\rho_i}{\sigma_i} e^{i (\gamma_i - \omega \tau_i)} h(\omega; \boldsymbol\theta_\mathrm{in}).
\end{equation}

The prevailing technique for detection of \acp{GW} from \acp{CBC} is to realize a \ac{MLE} from \Eref{eq:gaussian-likelihood} with the above signal model. This takes the form of a bank of matched filters, or template waveforms that are continually convolved with the incoming data stream. The matched filter or \ac{ML} estimates are given by
%
\begin{eqnarray}
\hat{\boldsymbol\theta}_i, \{\hat\tau_i\}_i &=& \argmax_{\boldsymbol\theta_\mathrm{in}, \{\hat\tau_i\}_i} \sum_i \frac{1}{{\sigma_i}^2} \left| \int_0^\infty \frac{h^*(\omega; \boldsymbol\theta_\mathrm{in}) x_i(\omega) e^{-i \omega \tau_i}}{S_i(\omega)} \,\mathrm{d}\omega \right|^2 \\
\hat\rho_i &=& \frac{1}{\sigma_i} \left| \int_0^\infty \frac{h^*(\omega; \hat{\boldsymbol\theta}_\mathrm{in}) x_i(\omega) e^{-i \omega \hat\tau_i}}{S_i(\omega)} \,\mathrm{d}\omega \right| \\
\hat\gamma_i &=& \arg \int_0^\infty \frac{h^*(\omega; \hat{\boldsymbol\theta}_\mathrm{in}) x_i(\omega) e^{-i \omega \hat\tau_i}}{S_i(\omega)} \,\mathrm{d}\omega,
\end{eqnarray}
%
where the $^*$ denotes a complex conjugate.

\subsection{Bayesian probability and parameter estimation}

In the Bayesian framework, the parameters are inferred from the data by forming the posterior distribution, $p(\boldsymbol\theta|\mathbf x)$, which describes the probability of the parameters given the observations. Bayes' rule relates the likelihood $p(\mathbf x|\boldsymbol\theta)$ to the posterior $p(\boldsymbol\theta|\mathbf x)$,
%
\begin{equation}\label{bayes}
p(\boldsymbol\theta|\mathbf x) = \frac{p(\mathbf x|\boldsymbol\theta) p(\boldsymbol\theta)}{p(\mathbf x)},
\end{equation}
%
introducing the prior distribution $p(\boldsymbol\theta)$ which encapsulates previous information about the paramters (for example, arising from earlier observations or from known physical bounds on the parameters), and the evidence $p(\mathbf x)$ which can be thought of as a normalization factor or as describing the parsimoniousness of the model.

The choice of prior is open to one's astrophysical preconceptions, but during \ac{S6} when \ac{LIGO}'s Bayesian \ac{CBC} parameter estimation pipelines were pioneered, the prior was taken to be isotropic in sky location and binary orientation, and uniform in volume, arrival time, and the component masses~\cite{2013arXiv1304.1775T}. Put briefly, the prior was uniform in all of $(\alpha, \sin\delta, {D_\mathrm{L}}^3, t_\oplus, \cos\iota, \psi, \phi_c, m_1, m_2)$.

In Bayesian inference, although it is often easy to write down the likelihood or even the full posterior in closed form, usually one is interested in only a subset $\boldsymbol\beta$ of all of the model's parameters, the others $\boldsymbol\lambda$ being nuisance parameters. In this case, we integrate away the nuisance parameters, forming the marginal posterior
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:marginal-posterior}
	p(\boldsymbol\beta|\mathbf x) = \int \frac{p(\mathbf x|\boldsymbol\beta,\boldsymbol\lambda) p(\boldsymbol\beta,\boldsymbol\lambda)}{p(\mathbf x)} \,\mathrm{d}\boldsymbol\lambda
\end{equation}
%
with $\boldsymbol\theta = (\boldsymbol\beta, \boldsymbol\lambda)$. For instance, for the purpose of locating a \ac{GW} source on the sky, all parameters but $(\alpha, \delta)$ are nuisance parameters.

\section{Measurement uncertainty}

The \ac{CRLB} is a useful analytical tool for predicting with what error an unknown parameter or parameters can be estimated from noisy observations. When an unbiased estimator exists, the \ac{CRLB} bound says that the covariance of the estimation error is bounded below by the Fisher information matrix. The \ac{CRLB} has been widely applied in \ac{GW} astronomy, for instance by \cite{fairhurst:2009} to predict the sky localization accuracy that is achievable with \ac{GW} observations. Here, we review the Fisher matrix calculation in \cite{fairhurst:2009} but add some physical interpretation to the particular structure of the covariance matrix.

\subsection{Fisher matrix}

In the frequency domain, the strain $X (\omega)$ observed by a detector is a linear combination of two orthogonal \ac{GW} quadratures and additive noise,
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:signal-model}
	x (\omega) = h (\omega, \rho, \gamma, \tau) + n (\omega) = \frac{\rho}{\sigma} e^{i (\gamma - \omega \tau)} u (\omega) + n (\omega),
\end{equation}
%
where $h (\omega)$ is the signal content, $n (\omega)$ is the detector's \ac{WSS} Gaussian noise with \ac{PSD} $S(\omega)$, $u (\omega)$ is the frequency-domain post-Newtonian inspiral signal, $\rho$ is the signal's amplitude, $\gamma$ is a phase angle the encodes the relative strength of two \ac{GW} quadratures, and $\tau$ is the time of arrival relative to an arbitrary time base. The quantity $\sigma$ is a normalization constant defined as the \ac{SNR} of the \ac{GW} source at a fiducial distance, here taken to be $D_\mathrm{fiducial} = 1$~Mpc,
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:sigma}
    \sigma^2 = \int_0^\infty \frac{\left| u (\omega)\right|^2}{S(\omega)} \, \mathrm{d}\omega.
\end{equation}
%
The distance at which an optimally oriented \ac{GW} source would produce \ac{SNR}=1 is defined as $D_1 = D_\mathrm{fiducial} / \sigma$. The likelihood, or the probability of obtaining the observation $x(\omega)$ conditioned on the value of the parameter vector $\boldsymbol\theta = (\rho, \gamma, \tau)$, is Gaussian, with the log-likelihood proportional to:
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:gaussian-likelihood}
	\mathcal{L}(x; \boldsymbol\theta) = p(x | \boldsymbol\theta)
		\propto \exp \left[
		- \frac{1}{2} \int_0^\infty \frac{\left|x (\omega)
			- h(\omega; \boldsymbol\theta) \right|^2}{S(\omega)} \, \mathrm{d}\omega
	\right].
\end{equation}

The Fisher information matrix for a measurement $\tilde x$ described by the unknown parameter vector $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ is
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:general-fisher-matrix}
	\mathcal{I}_{jk} = \mathrm{E} \, \left[
		-\frac{\partial^2 \log
			\mathcal{L}(x ; \boldsymbol\theta)}
			{\partial \theta_j \theta_k}
	\right].
\end{equation}
%
This equation involves double derivatives, but substantial simplification is possible when---as in this case---the likelihood is Gaussian:
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:gaussian-fisher-matrix}
	\mathcal{I}_{jk} = \int_0^\infty \Re \left[
        \left(\frac{\partial h}{\partial \theta_j}\right)^*
        \left(\frac{\partial h}{\partial \theta_k}\right)
	\right] \frac{1}{S(\omega)} \, \mathrm{d}\omega.
\end{equation}
%
This form is more useful because it involves only first derivatives, and of the signal $\tilde h (\omega)$ rather than the entire observation $\tilde x (\omega)$. In terms of the $k$th \ac{SNR}-weighted moment of angular frequency,
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:angular-frequency-moments}
    \overline{\omega^k} =
        \left[ \int_0^\infty \frac{|u (\omega)|^2}{S(\omega)} \omega^k \, \mathrm{d}\omega \right]
        \left[ \int_0^\infty \frac{|u (\omega)|^2}{S(\omega)} \, \mathrm{d}\omega \right]^{-1},
\end{equation}
%
the Fisher matrix for the signal model in \Eref{eq:signal-model} is
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:fisher-matrix}
	\mathcal{I} = \bordermatrix{
        ~ & \rho & \gamma & \tau \cr
        \rho & 1 & 0 & 0 \cr
        \gamma & 0 & \rho^2 & -\rho^2 \overline{\omega} \cr
        \tau & 0 & -\rho^2 \overline{\omega} & \rho^2 \overline{\omega^2}
    }.
\end{equation}

\subsection{\ac{CRLB} and physical interpretation}

The \ac{CRLB} says that, element by element,
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:covariance-matrix}
    \cov{
        \left(
        \begin{array}{c}
            \hat{\rho} - \rho \\
            \hat{\gamma} - \gamma \\
            \hat{\tau} - \tau
        \end{array}
        \right)
    } \geq \mathcal{I}^{-1} = \left(
        \begin{array}{ccc}
            1 & 0 & 0 \\
            0 & \rho^2 \overline{\omega^2}/{\omega_\mathrm{rms}}^2 & \rho^2 \overline{\omega}/{\omega_\mathrm{rms}}^2 \\
            0 & \rho^2 \overline{\omega}/{\omega_\mathrm{rms}}^2 & \rho^2/{\omega_\mathrm{rms}}^2
        \end{array}
    \right)
\end{equation}
%
where a hat $\hat{\phantom{\rho}}$ denotes the estimate of a parameter and ${\omega_\mathrm{rms}}^2 = \overline{\omega^2} - \overline{\omega}^2$. Reading off the $\tau \tau$ element of the covariance matrix reproduces the timing accuracy in Equation~(24) of \cite{fairhurst:2009},
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:timing-crlb}
    \std \left(\hat{\tau} - \tau \right) \geq \sqrt{\left(\mathcal{I}^{-1}\right)_{\tau\tau}} = \frac{\rho}{\omega_\mathrm{rms}}.
\end{equation}

\marginpar{Plot covariance ellipses and estimator samples for each change of variables; that would be a nice visual here.}%
%
Furthermore, the Fisher matrix in \Eref{eq:fisher-matrix} is block diagonal, which implies that estimation errors in the signal amplitude $\rho$ are uncorrelated with the phase $\gamma$ and time $\tau$. A sequence of two changes of variables lends some physical interpretation to the nature of the coupled estimation errors in $\gamma$ and $\tau$.

First, we put the phase and time on the same footing by measuring the time in units of $1 / 2 \pi \sqrt{\overline{\omega^2}}$ with a change of variables from $\tau$ to $\gamma_\tau = 2 \pi \sqrt{\overline{\omega^2}} \tau$:
%
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{I}' = \bordermatrix{
        ~ & \rho & \gamma & \gamma_\tau \cr
        \rho & 1 & 0 & 0 \cr
        \gamma & 0 & \rho^2 & -\rho^2\frac{\overline{\omega}}{\sqrt{\overline{\omega^2}}} \cr
        \gamma_\tau & 0 & -\rho^2\frac{\overline{\omega}}{\sqrt{\overline{\omega^2}}} & \rho^2
    }.
\end{equation}

The second change of variables, from $\gamma$ and $\gamma_\tau$ to $\gamma_\pm = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\gamma \pm \gamma_\tau)$, diagonalizes the Fisher matrix:
%
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{I}'' = \bordermatrix{
        ~ & \rho & \gamma_+ & \gamma_- \cr
        \rho & 1 & 0 & 0 \cr
        \gamma_+ & 0 & \left(1 - \frac{\overline{\omega}}{\sqrt{\overline{\omega^2}}}\right)\rho^2 & 0 \cr
        \gamma_- & 0 & 0 & \left(1 + \frac{\overline{\omega}}{\sqrt{\overline{\omega^2}}}\right)\rho^2
    }.
\end{equation}
%
Thus, in the appopriate time units, the \textit{sum and difference} of the phase and time of the signal are measured independently.

\subsection{Noise model for point parameters}

The likelihood in \Eref{eq:gaussian-likelihood} is the quantity that is maximized by the matched\nobreakdashes-filter estimator. However, just because we have the covariance matrix defined by \Eref{eq:covariance-matrix} does not mean that the distribution of estimator errors is multivariate Gaussian. Nonetheless, it is straightforward to qualitatively describe the distribution.

If we were to suppress the time parameter $\tau$, then we could reduce the likelihood to the form
%
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{L}(z; \rho, \gamma) \propto \exp \left[ -\frac{1}{2} \left|z - e^{i \gamma} \rho \right|^2 \right]
\end{equation}
%
for a complex scalar measurement $z$. This likelihood also describes the distribution of the length $\rho$ and angle $\gamma$ of a vector whose Cartesian components are perturbed with normally distributed errors. For this problem, $\rho$ and $\gamma$ are uncorrelated, $\rho^2$ being noncentrally $\chi^2$\nobreakdashes-disributed with two degrees of freedom and $\gamma$ being von~Mises\nobreakdashes-distributed.
%
\marginpar{Picture here?}

\marginpar{What about if we suppress $\gamma$ or $\rho$? Do those cases teach us anything?}
%
We know that the matched\nobreakdashes-filter estimator's distribution, given a particular true value of $\rho$, $\gamma$, and $\tau$, must go to zero at $\hat{\rho}=0$ and must be periodic in $\gamma$ but not $\tau$. From just these properties, the estimator's distribution should be an approximate Gaussian, but wrapped diagonally around a cylinder where the radius represents $\hat{\rho}$, the angle around the cylinder represents $\hat{\gamma}$, and the distance up or down the cylinder represents $\hat{\tau}$.

There are many ways to realize distribution function with these properties, but they tend to be difficult to work with.
%
\marginpar{Give some examples.}

An alternative is to just discard the one periodic parameter, $\gamma$, entirely. We do not know the exact distribution of the remaining parameters $\rho$ and $\tau$, but we are less liable to make egregious errors by assuming that they are Gaussian than if we assumed that the estimation errors in $\gamma$ were Gaussian. Projecting out $\gamma$ gives us the covariance matrix
%
\begin{equation}
    \cov \left(
        \begin{array}{c}
            \hat{\rho} - \rho \\
            \hat{\tau} - \tau
        \end{array}
    \right) =
    \left(
        \begin{array}{cc}
            1 & 0 \\
            0 & \rho^2/{\omega_\mathrm{rms}}^2
        \end{array}
    \right).
\end{equation}

A wrinkle is that this covariance matrix still depends on the true, unknown value of $\rho$. If we make the further leap of evaluating the \ac{CRLB} \emph{at the value of the estimators}, we can then write the distribution of the estimator error as
%
\begin{eqnarray}
    \hat{\rho} - \rho \sim \mathcal{N}\, [0, 1] \\
    \hat{\tau} - \tau \sim \mathcal{N} \left[0, \hat{\rho}^2 / {\omega_\mathrm{rms}}^2\right],
\end{eqnarray}
%
valid at moderate to high \ac{SNR}.

\section{Method}

\subsection{Likelihood}

\marginpar{Explain why none of these expressions depend on the coalescence phase $\phi_c$.}%
%
If we assume that the time and amplitude estimation errors are uncorrelated, then we can separate the likelihood into one factor that depends only on time and one that depends only on amplitude:
%
\begin{eqnarray*}
    \mathcal{L}(
        \hat{\tau}_1, \hat{\tau}_2, &\dots, \hat{\tau}_N,
        \hat{\rho}_1, \hat{\rho}_2, \dots, \hat{\rho}_N;
        \mathbf{n}, t_\oplus, D_\mathrm{L}, x, \psi) \\
    &= \mathcal{L}_\mathrm{TOA}(
        \hat{\tau}_1, \hat{\tau}_2, \dots, \hat{\tau}_N; \mathbf{n}, t_\oplus) \\
        &\times
        \mathcal{L}_\mathrm{SNR}(\hat{\rho}_1, \hat{\rho}_2, \dots, \hat{\rho}_N;
         \mathbf{n}, D_\mathrm{L}, x, \psi
    ).
\end{eqnarray*}
%
The \ac{TOA}-only factor depends only on the \ac{TOA} estimates $\hat{\tau}_1, \hat{\tau}_2, \dots, \hat{\tau}_N$, the unknown sky location $\mathbf{n}$ (or equivalently, the right ascension $\alpha$, declination $\delta$, and sidereal time), and the absolute \ac{TOA} at an arbitrary reference point (herein, the geocenter), $t_\oplus$, the fixed geographical locations of the detectors, $\mathbf{r}_i$, and the speed of light $c$.
%
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{L}_\mathrm{TOA} \propto
    \exp \left[
            -\frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^N \frac{\left(\hat{\tau}_i - \tau_i\right)^2}{\left(\hat{\rho_i} / \omega_{\mathrm{rms},i}\right)^2}
        \right]
    = \exp \left[
        -\frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^N \frac{\left(\hat{\tau}_i + \mathbf{n} \cdot \mathbf{r}_i / c - t_\oplus \right)^2}{\left(\hat{\rho_i} / \omega_{\mathrm{rms},i}\right)^2}
    \right]
\end{equation}
%
The \ac{SNR}-only factor depends only on the \ac{SNR} estimates $\hat{\rho}_1, \hat{\rho}_2, \dots, \hat{\rho}_N$, but it depends on the unknown sky location, luminosity distance $D_\mathrm{L}$, cosine-inclination $x = \cos \iota$, and polarization angle $\psi$.
%
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{L}_\mathrm{SNR} \propto \exp \left[
        -\frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^N \left(\hat{\rho}_i - \rho_i(\mathbf{n}, D_\mathrm{L}, x, \psi) \right)^2
    \right]
\end{equation}
%
\marginpar{Cite \ac{GRB} prospects paper appendix; a very similar equation appears there. Is there somewhere else that has this formula? Shutz doesn't, and Finn \& Chernoff's notation is too heavy.}%
%
It is easily shown that
%
\begin{eqnarray*}
    {\rho_i}^2 &=
        \frac{1}{8} \left(\frac{D_{1,i}}{D_\mathrm{L}}\right)^2 \left[
            ( {F_{+,i}}^2 + {F_{\times,i}}^2 \right)
            \left(1 + 6 x^2 + x^4 \right) \\
            &+ \left(1 - x^2 \right) \left( {F_{+,i}}^2 - {F_{\times,i}}^2 \right) \cos {2\psi}
            + 2 \left( {F_{+,i}} {F_{\times,i}} ) \sin {2\psi}
        \right],
\end{eqnarray*}
%
where $F_{+,i}$ and $F_{\times,i}$ are the `$+$' and `$\times$' antenna factors of detector $i$, themselves functions of sky location $\mathbf{n}$.

\subsection{Prior}

$t_\oplus$, $m_1$, $m_2$, ${D_\mathrm{L}}^3$ (volume)
Prior is uniform in $\mathbf{n}$, $t_\oplus$, x, and $\psi$. For distance, can choose either a prior that is uniform in $\log D_\mathrm{L}$ or uniform in volume. \cite{2013arXiv1304.1775T}

\subsection{Marginalization}

The overall arrival time $t_\oplus$ can be marginalized out analytically, giving the \ac{TOA}-only marginal posterior
%
\begin{equation}
    p(\mathbf{n} | \hat{\tau}_1, \hat{\tau}_2, \dots, \hat{\tau}_N) \propto \exp\left[
        -\frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^N \frac{\left( \tilde{\tau}_i - \langle \tilde{\tau} \rangle \right)^2}{\left(\hat{\rho_i} / \omega_{\mathrm{rms},i}\right)^2}
    \right]
\end{equation}
%
where
%
\begin{equation}
    \langle \tilde{\tau} \rangle =
    \left(\sum_{i=1}^N \frac{{\tilde{\tau}_i}^2}{\left(\hat{\rho_i} / \omega_{\mathrm{rms},i}\right)^2}\right)\left(\sum_{i=1}^N \frac{1}{\left(\hat{\rho_i} / \omega_{\mathrm{rms},i}\right)^2}\right)^{-1}.
\end{equation}

The marginalization over $D_\mathrm{L}$, $x$, and $\psi$ must be done numerically. The outermost integration is over x and $\psi$, and is done with Newton--Cotes by evaluating $\mathcal{L}_\mathrm{SNR}$ on a regular lattice in $x$ and $\psi$. This integration scheme is first order in $x$ and second order in $\psi$.

\marginpar{Explain initial integration breakpoints and how they are calculated. Cite \texttt{gsl\_integrate\_qagp}.}%
%
The innermost integration is over $D_\mathrm{L}$ and is performed using adaptive Gaussian quadrature, but with a twist that speeds up convergence.
